<h5>The reason I picked this portrait as opposed to the other two I made is due to the fact that the colors came out better in the J Cole picture. The reason I chose J Cole as my celebrity is because I like his music and he's a pretty chill person that has been through many difficulties.
For the colors I tried to focus on primary colors and adding complementary colors to make them pop out. The way I come up with the colors I have is by using a hue color range and picking the colors I believed looked best.</h5>

<h5> My original shape was a flower and the reason I chose it is because personally I believed it would look better than using an animal. For my colors I used solid colors instead of gradients since it would look better. In order to create a mandala we had to do a lot of rotating and scaling along with a lot of copy and pasting or duplicating.

<h5> The animals I used in my first creature were duck, turtle, shark fin, penguin legs and a unicorn horn. The reason behind these creatures is to show its superior defensive skills. My second creature consisted of a monkey, a gorilla, a lion tail and an elephant. The reason behind  the use of these creatures is to show its superior strength. In order to mix these creatures i had to cut out the background and unnecessary body parts and put them where i want to.

<h5> My original image was a picture of chicken wings and the reason I chose it was because it looked like someone good chicken. For this image I used a variation of hues/saturations along with contrast and brightness and color inversion. The first thing i did was change the hues and saturation then i used inverse colors and added contrast and brightness several times to get this.</h5>
