	   <h1> Lucid Dreams</h1>
   <h3> By Juice Wrld </h3>
    <p class = "p1"> I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

     <p class = "p2">Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
       I won't let you forget me</p>
       
<p class = "p3">You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
  I know it's all in my head</p>
<p class ="p4">I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
  Now I'm just better off dead (uh, uh, uh)</p>
